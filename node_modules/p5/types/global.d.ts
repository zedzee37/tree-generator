   * Its shape is a pyramid with its top cut off. The camera is placed where
   * the top of the pyramid should be and views everything between the frustum’s
   * top (near) plane and its bottom (far) plane.The first parameter, `fovy`, is the camera’s vertical field of view. It’s
   * an angle that describes how tall or narrow a view the camera has. For
   * example, calling `perspective(0.5)` sets the camera’s vertical field of
   * view to 0.5 radians. By default, `fovy` is calculated based on the sketch’s
   * height and the camera’s default z-coordinate, which is 800. The formula for
   * the default `fovy` is `2 * atan(height / 2 / 800)`.The second parameter, `aspect`, is the camera’s aspect ratio. It’s a number
   * that describes the ratio of the top plane’s width to its height. For
   * example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5)` sets the camera’s field of view to
   * 0.5 radians and aspect ratio to 1.5, which would make shapes appear thinner
   * on a square canvas. By default, aspect is set to `width / height`.The third parameter, `near`, is the distance from the camera to the near
   * plane. For example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100)` sets the camera’s
   * field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, and places the near
   * plane 100 pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn less than 100 pixels
   * from the camera won’t be visible. By default, near is set to `0.1 * 800`,
   * which is 1/10th the default distance between the camera and the origin.The fourth parameter, `far`, is the distance from the camera to the far
   * plane. For example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100, 10000)` sets the
   * camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, places the
   * near plane 100 pixels from the camera, and places the far plane 10,000
   * pixels from the camera. Any shapes drawn more than 10,000 pixels from the
